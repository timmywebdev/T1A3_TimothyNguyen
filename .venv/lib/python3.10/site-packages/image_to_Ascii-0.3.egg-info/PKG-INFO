## How do I generate an Ascii art from image?
You can use any text editor you want, but personally I like to use VSC.
1) Create an empty .py file called 'filename.py'
2) Copy this text into your new file:
```py
from image_to_ascii import ImageToAscii
# imagePath is for path of the image you want to convert to Ascii
# outputFile is for the file path of where the generated Ascii art should be stored keep None if you don't want to store it in a .txt file
ImageToAscii(imagePath="path/to/file",outputFile="output.txt")
```
